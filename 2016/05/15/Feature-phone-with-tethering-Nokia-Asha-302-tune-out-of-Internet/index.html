  <title>Feature phone with tethering (Nokia Asha 302) - tune out of Internet | Random Howtos</title>
  <meta name="author" content="Philipp Keller">
  
  <meta name="description" content="Since the days of the iPhone finding the right way to handle the mobile phone is challenging to me. Working in web programming and being a father and husband at the same time is means that I need to be able to connect to my colleagues at work when not at my desk while being able to &amp;ldquo;tune out&amp;rdquo; while being with my family.
My latest try at the problem was to buy a &amp;ldquo;feature phone&amp;rdquo; which was good enough to support the bare minimum (apart phone calls and SMS this is WhatsApp and internet tethering for my tablet/laptop) but was dumb enough that it would not tempt me away to check any news/mails while being with my family. I came across the &amp;ldquo;Nokia Asha 302&amp;rdquo; which is no longer produced but IMO was selling bad enough that there are some in stock in the most countries (at least that was in case here in Switzerland).
I&amp;rsquo;m on this &amp;ldquo;feature phone&amp;rdquo; now since a few days and must say that I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with it. When I am at work I just take my android tablet (nvidia shield k1) with me, if I want to tune out I can leave the house with my mobile only. As it is an outdated phone there are some tweaks you need to do which I documented below:">

<p>Since the days of the iPhone finding the right way to handle the mobile phone is challenging to me. Working in web programming and being a father and husband at the same time is means that I need to be able to connect to my colleagues at work when not at my desk while being able to &ldquo;tune out&rdquo; while being with my family.</p>
<p>My latest try at the problem was to buy a &ldquo;feature phone&rdquo; which was good enough to support the bare minimum (apart phone calls and SMS this is WhatsApp and internet tethering for my tablet/laptop) but was dumb enough that it would not tempt me away to check any news/mails while being with my family.

<h1 id="Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Tips and Tricks"></a>Tips and Tricks</h1><h2 id="Install-WhatsApp"><a href="#Install-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="Install WhatsApp"></a>Install WhatsApp</h2><p>When trying to access the nokia store the first time I got</p>
<blockquote>
<p>certificate not valid according to phone&rsquo;s date</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What solved the issue for me was to set the date a few years back (I think I tried 2013). After the store was updated I needed to set the date back to the current date in order to download WhatsApp (otherwise it triggers another certificate exception)</p>
<h2 id="Install-Google-Maps"><a href="#Install-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Install Google Maps"></a>Install Google Maps</h2><p>Go to <a href="http://www.getjar.com" target="_blank" rel="external">getjar.com</a> with your mobile and search for &ldquo;map&rdquo; -&gt; lets you install google maps on your s40 based phone even though google maps is no longer officially supported for this series.</p>
<h2 id="Tethering"><a href="#Tethering" class="headerlink" title="Tethering"></a>Tethering</h2><p>Just enable bluetooth on your mobile, pair device and connect to network.</p>
<h2 id="Phone-doesn-rsquo-t-turn-on"><a href="#Phone-doesn-rsquo-t-turn-on" class="headerlink" title="Phone doesn&rsquo;t turn on"></a>Phone doesn&rsquo;t turn on</h2><p>I had this when trying to charge with a wrong adapter. Asha 302 said it was charging but in fact it was not, just change to a different adapter</p>
<h2 id="Headphones"><a href="#Headphones" class="headerlink" title="Headphones"></a>Headphones</h2><p>All headphones with three rings do not work (e.g. iphone headphones), but the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; headphones without mic with just two rings do work.</p>
