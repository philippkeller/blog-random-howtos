I have long dreamed for a setup which lets me just press the scan button on my scanner and without any further input it uploads it as a searchable PDF onto some cloud store. Thanks to the good support of scanners by SANE and the ease of use of AWS lambda it's actually *quite* easy (judging to the length of this post it looks like quite a task, but in the end it is straightforwards and is - surprisingly - quite free of hacks).

In this solution you:

- set up SANE on your raspberry pi 3 so it scans your document
- set up scanbd to detect the scan button
- set up a S3 bucket for uploading
- set up a lambda function which uses tesseract to create a searchable PDF

What you need:

- Raspberry Pi 3 (I guess the other models serve equally well)
- Paper scanner with a "scan" button which is [supported by saned](http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html)
- an AWS account

Personally I'm using Raspbian Stretch Lite as OS on my Raspberry and a Fujitsu S1300i.

# Set up SANE

First I tried to compile SANE from source, believing that this is the only way to get my scanner to work. After hours of trying and simplifying this howto (And after I wiped the pi3 two times to start over!) I figured out that apt install works just fine! So bear in mind that this howto was done with sweat and after hours of painful try-and-error :)

Before you start: you might just want to wipe your pi and start fresh. Takes you about 15 minutes extra, you can [follow my howto](http://localhost:4000/2018/01/20/How-to-set-up-raspberry-pi-headless-with-ssh-and-wifi/) so you can do that headless (without attaching monitor/keyboard to the pi).

## Install Sane

Just install:

```bash
sudo apt install sane-utils -y
```

No need to install the whole `saned` package which comes with tons of packages. sane-utils is enough. Now, when you plug your scanner to your pi and do..

```bash
sudo sane-find-scanner -q
```

.. you should see something like this:

```shell
found USB scanner (vendor=0x04c6 [FUJITSU], product=0x128d [ScanSnap S1300i]) at libusb:001:011
found USB scanner (vendor=0x0424, product=0xec00) at libusb:001:003
```

That is, your scanner is already detected by sane. Now, throughout this howto I'll use user `pi` to run the processes. You can choose to go for another user, but please don't use `root` for it. 

To give your user `pi` the permission to scan you'd do:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G scanner pi # makes it available for pi
```

This works because the group `scanner` is configured in `/etc/udev/rules.d/*.conf` to access the scanner. If this step does not work then [this section](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SANE#Permission_problem) might help you to troubleshoot.


You still can't scan though because you need to install the firmware file for your scanner. First find out where the firmware needs to sit: Grep for your model (in my case scansnap 1300i):

```bash
grep 1300i /etc/sane.d/*.conf
```

Shows you something like:

```shell
/etc/sane.d/epjitsu.conf:# Fujitsu S1300i
/etc/sane.d/epjitsu.conf:firmware /usr/share/sane/epjitsu/1300i_0D12.nal
```

So all you'd need to do is get this `1300i_0D12.nal` file. From you installation files you got with your scanner, or just google for your firmware file and hope that there's no security concerns.. In my case I found it on github and installed it with:

```
sudo mkdir /usr/share/sane/epjitsu/
sudo wget https://github.com/ckunte/sfware/raw/master/1300i_0D12.nal -O /usr/share/sane/epjitsu/1300i_0D12.nal
```

Now you should be able to insert a document into the scanner and ..

```
scanimage >/tmp/out.pnm
```

.. should produce a nice [PNM file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats#PPM,_PGM,_PBM,_and_PNM) ready to be further processed.

# scanbd

```
sudo apt install scanbd -y
sudo vim /etc/scandb/scandb.conf # set debug-level=7, user=pi
sudo scanbd -f
```

```
sudo vim /etc/scandb/scandb.conf # set script_dir=/etc/scanbd/scripts, in action 'scan': desc="Scan to a file and upload to s3", script="scan.sh"
sudo mkdir /etc/scanbd/scripts/
sudo vim /etc/scanbd/scripts/scan.sh
sudo chmod a+x /etc/scanbd/scripts/scan.sh
```

replug scanner, test with `sudo scanbd -f`
close lid, open lid -> segementation fault

```
sudo vim /lib/systemd/system/scanbd.service # add Restart=on-failure
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo service scanbd start
sudo update-rc.d scanbd enable
```

# s3 script

```
sudo apt install python-pip -y
sudo pip install awscli
aws configure
aws s3 ls s3://scanner-upload/
```

```
#!/bin/sh

set -e
export TMP_DIR=`mktemp -d`

echo 'scanning..'
scanimage --resolution 300 --batch="$TMP_DIR/scan_%03d.pnm" --format=pnm --mode Gray --source "ADF Duplex"

echo 'packaging and uploading in subshell'
(tarname=scan_$(date "+%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S").tar.gz
cd $TMP_DIR
tar -czf $tarname *.pnm
echo 'uploading..'
aws s3 cp $TMP_DIR/$tarname s3://scanner-upload/
rm -rf $TMP_DIR
echo 'done') &
```



# 1. Make sane work with fujitsu 1300i

There are plenty of howtos out there how to get Fujitsu 1300i running with raspberry pi (my favourite one was [this one](https://www.splitbrain.org/blog/2014-08/23-paper_backup_1_scanner_setup)), but for completeness sake here it is again (and the bottom doc bases on this exact setup)

## Install driver/sane/...


```
sudo apt install git-core libusb-dev -y
cd /var/tmp/
git clone git://git.debian.org/sane/sane-backends.git
cd sane-backends/
BACKENDS=epjitsu ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
make
sudo make install
cd /usr/share/sane/epjitsu/
sudo curl https://github.com/ckunte/sfware/raw/master/1300i_0D12.nal -L -O
```



```
sudo vim 
```


## Test with root

Now, `sudo sane-find-scanner -q` should show something like:

```
found USB scanner (vendor=0x04c6 [FUJITSU], product=0x128d [ScanSnap S1300i]) at libusb:001:011
found USB scanner (vendor=0x0424, product=0xec00) at libusb:001:003
```

Do a test scan: `sudo scanimage >/tmp/out.pnm`

Now you could try to get it to run with user `pi` but after some messing around I gave it up. The setup [mentioned in this doc](https://www.splitbrain.org/blog/2014-08/23-paper_backup_1_scanner_setup#sane_permissions) did not work for me

# 2. Detect scanner button pressed

## Install scanbd

Install scanbd via `apt`. Be sure to hit `N` when being asked about overwriting `dll.conf` and `epjitsu.conf`:

```
sudo apt install scanbd
```

Scanbd is a daemon which polls the scanner button and starts a custom scripts when the button is pressed. In the script you'll use the sane setup you just did.

First, we'll do a quick test just to see that scanbd does its job: Edit `/etc/scanbd/scanbd.conf` ((if the config file is missing, as it was in my case when I initially installed with `apt` you can take [this initial scanbd.conf](https://gist.github.com/philippkeller/f2dafcd8c9e22e691b2a21ca9746303c) as a start) and:

- set `debug-level=7`, that's just for the beginning until we're sure that everything works
- set `user=root`, as we just made saned run in the root user

Start scanbd with `sudo scanbd -f` and you'll the the polling. When you hit the scan button then you'll see that it tries running `/etc/scanbd/scripts/test.script` which doesn't exist yet. So far, so good!

<!--

Unfortunately the scanbd version which - at the time of this blog post - is in the repo has [an annoying bug which causes scanbd to crash (segfault) when you close/unplug the scanner and replug it again](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/scanbd/+bug/1500095).

If `apt search scanbd` gives you a version > 1.5.1-1 then you can just install it with `sudo apt install scan scanbuttond` and skip to the next section.

To compile from source, do the following:

```
sudo apt install libconfuse-dev libdbus-1-dev libsane-dev -y
cd /var/tmp/
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/scanbd/files/latest/download?source=files -O scanbd.tar.gz
tar -xzvf scanbd.tar.gz
cd 1.5.1
./configure
make
sudo make install
```



## Configure scanbd

Contrary to some howtos on the net you don't need to copy files, etc. Scanbd just uses the just sane client to regularly poll the button and then starts a custom script.

First, you need to check where the scanbd config file is. Do `man scanbd` and check the `-c` option. For older versions (ie.g. installed via apt) this is in `/etc/scanbd/scanbd.conf`, for newer (i.e. compiled from source) this is in `/usr/local/etc/scanbd/scanbd.conf`.

Now, adapt your config file like this (if the config file is missing, as it was in my case when I initially installed with `apt` you can take [this initial scanbd.conf](https://gist.github.com/philippkeller/9d6a6ccea6c448bedd67338e8eb98870) as a start):
-->


## Configure scanbd

In `/etc/scanbd/scanbd.conf`:

- set `scriptdir = /etc/scanbd/scripts`
- in action `scan` set `desc="Scan to file and upload to s3"` and `script=scan.sh`

Then, after `mkdir /etc/scanbd/scripts` put that into `/etc/scanbd/scripts/scan.sh` just to test (don't forget to `chmod a+x` the file):

```
#!/bin/sh
scanimage > /tmp/foo.pnm
```

Start scanbd with `sudo scanbd -f` and you should see the polling and your script being called. `cat /var/tmp/foo.txt` should show a bunch of "scan button pressed" lines. Wohoo!

## Test via service

Now, also test if it works when you start it with `sudo service scanbd start`. If you have any problems then you might need to correct `ExecStart` and `SANE_CONFIG_DIR` with the correct directories and reload it with `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.

To see the logs, do `tail -f /var/log/syslog`

Now, scanbd [has a bug so when you close/open your printer or reconnect the usb it segfaults](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/scanbd/+bug/1500095). The versions > 1.5.1.1 have fixed this bug. I tried to use those but then it just didn't carry on after replugging so I went back to the version provided by `apt`.

To work around the segfault it is actually easier to

- add `Restart=on-failure` to `/lib/systemd/system/scanbd.service`
- reload `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`

Now you should be able to close the lid of the scanner, see the usb disconnect message in `/var/log/syslog`, then open the lid and the scanner button should still work.

# 3. Make the scanner upload to s3

## Preparing S3

- create an s3 bucket, e.g. `scanner-upload` (be sure to choose a region close to you. Upload speed is a lot faster for closer regions). Note the ARN of the bucket.
- in IAM create a policy `scanner-upload`, swith into JSON editor and paste this (replace the arn):

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::scanner-upload"]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::scanner-upload/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- in IAM create a user and attach the `scanner-upload` policy. Note the key/secret or download the csv
- install `aws cli` on raspberry pi: `sudo pip install awscli --upgrade --user` (be sure to use `sudo`, otherwise it'll be installed into `~/.local/bin/` which might not be in your `$PATH`)
- start `aws configure` to put the key/secret and aws region into your config
- test that s3 access works with `aws s3 ls s3://scanner-upload/` and uploading a file using `aws s3 cp some_file.txt s3://scanner-upload/`

## Put `scan.sh` into place

Put this into `/etc/scanbd/scan.sh` (replace `scanner-upload` with your bucket name):

```
#!/bin/sh

set -e
TMP_DIR=`mktemp -d`

echo 'scanning..'
scanimage --resolution 300 --batch="$TMP_DIR/scan_%03d.pnm" --format=pnm --mode Gray --source "ADF Duplex"

echo 'packaging..'
tarname=scan_$(date "+%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S").tar.gz
cd $TMP_DIR
tar -czf $tarname *.pnm

echo 'uploading..'
aws s3 cp $TMP_DIR/$tarname s3://scanner-upload/
rm -rf $TMP_DIR
```

You might want to play around with the `scanimage` command. In the above script it

- scans in batch mode: creates multiple files until the feeder is empty
- does a duplex scan (there's no detection. It means that if it's a one sided paper the second page is just empty)
- `resolution 300`: this is the default. It is a pretty fast scan and the quality is good enough

Try to call the script manually and then start `scanbd -f`. Now pressing the button will scan and upload to s3, whohoo!

## Start scanbd at boot time, and secure it

Make `scanbd` start at boot time: `sudo update-rc.d scanbd enable`.

Secure it: tbd (what happens when you close the lid..?)

## Cleaning up

If everything has worked this far you can decrease the logging level in scanbd.conf:

- set `debug-level=3` as level 7 is much too verbose
- set `debug=false`

remove the temp dirs:

- `rm -rf /var/tmp/sane-backends`
- `rm -rf /var/tmp/1.5.1`
