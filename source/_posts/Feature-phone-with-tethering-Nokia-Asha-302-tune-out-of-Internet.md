Since the days of the iPhone finding the right way to handle the mobile phone is challenging to me. Working in web programming and being a father and husband at the same time is means that I need to be able to connect to my colleagues at work when not at my desk while being able to &ldquo;tune out&rdquo; while being with my family.

My latest try at the problem was to buy a &ldquo;feature phone&rdquo; which was good enough to support the bare minimum (apart phone calls and SMS this is WhatsApp and internet tethering for my tablet/laptop) but was dumb enough that it would not tempt me away to check any news/mails while being with my family. I came across the &ldquo;Nokia Asha 302&rdquo; which is no longer produced but IMO was selling bad enough that there are some in stock in the most countries (at least that was in case here in Switzerland).

I&rsquo;m on this &ldquo;feature phone&rdquo; now since a few days and must say that I&rsquo;m quite happy with it. When I am at work I just take my android tablet (nvidia shield k1) with me, if I want to tune out I can leave the house with my mobile only. As it is an outdated phone there are some tweaks you need to do which I documented below:

# Tips and Tricks

## Install WhatsApp

When trying to access the nokia store the first time I got

> certificate not valid according to phone&rsquo;s date

What solved the issue for me was to set the date a few years back (I think I tried 2013). After the store was updated I needed to set the date back to the current date in order to download WhatsApp (otherwise it triggers another certificate exception)

## Install Google Maps

Go to [getjar.com](http://www.getjar.com) with your mobile and search for &ldquo;map&rdquo; -&gt; lets you install google maps on your s40 based phone even though google maps is no longer officially supported for this series.

## Tethering

Just enable bluetooth on your mobile, pair device and connect to network.

## Phone doesn&rsquo;t turn on

I had this when trying to charge with a wrong adapter. Asha 302 said it was charging but in fact it was not, just change to a different adapter

## Headphones

All headphones with three rings do not work (e.g. iphone headphones), but the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; headphones without mic with just two rings do work.
