Every time I change my wifi at home my HP color laser 150nw stops working and I need to spend more than 1 hour finding the right docs on the internet.

Here's what I found is working:

1. Download HP Smart app on your iPhone
2. Reset the printer by unplugging the power cord, press the power button for 15s, then plug the power, leave the power button pressed until you hear a click and the printer turns on
3. To be sure, reset the wifi by pressing the blue wifi button for 15s - the power button and an  button flash
4. Start the setup process in the HP Smart app: new printer, then click "printer not listed" -> Wifi
5. Then it prompts you to switch to your printers wifi. Do that. The wifi name should have "setup" in the name
6. If you choose the wifi network and it asks for a password you're stuck (online manuals say `12345678` is tha password or that it prints the password when pressing the green down button for 20s - both were not true for me) - you need to do the reset again
7. Now there should be a progress bar in your mobile app. For me it got stuck the first time so I needed to go back to step 2.

Yes, it seems like HP did a real quality product here.  
Not!
