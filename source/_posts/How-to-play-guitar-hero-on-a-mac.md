I had some plastic guitars from Guitar hero 3 lying around, but no xbox. After some effort to get it running on OS X (el capitan) I thought I share this:

1.  buy the [Microsoft Xbox Controller (USB)](https://www.amazon.com/_/dp/B000HZFCT2) (20$)
2.  install the [360Controller driver](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases) (these are still under development, unlike the tattiebogle drivers which seems to have stopped working)
3.  install [FoFix](https://code.google.com/archive/p/fofix/downloads) (the original frets on fire doesn&rsquo;t work anymore on El Capitan)
4.  install the Guitar Hero 3 theme and songs, as described in [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0_OoSTtTSc)

## Troubleshooting

### Guitar doesn&rsquo;t connect

To initially connect the guitar to the microsoft controller press the connect key on the guitar and the button on the controller. If that fails, then this worked for me:

1.  install a newer driver (go sure to uninstall the old driver first via it&rsquo;s preference pane -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Uninstall)
2.  plug out the controller from USB and connect it again
