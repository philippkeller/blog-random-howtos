For [last Webtuesday](http://www.webtuesday.ch/meetings/20070508) I gathered a few historic data of the «tag movement» (that got very quiet in the last two years).

<div class="caption">[![History of tags](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EFKH93Nx_sA/UL0B68HClVI/AAAAAAAALHw/pa3Ba1ha7tU/s800/tagging_history_900.gif)](/phred/images/tagging_history_900.gif)</div>

### <!-- more -->Gartners hype cycles applied to tag history

<span>I think </span>[gartners hype cycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle)<span> prove to be right when applied to the tag history (hype cycle descriptions taken from </span>[Floor eTrends](http://www.floor.nl/ebiz/gartnershypecycle.htm)<span>):</span>

**<span>Technology trigger</span>**

> <span>A breakthrough, public demonstration, product launch or other event that generates significant </span><span>press and industry interest.</span>

The technology trigger most likely was [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) and subsequently flickr adding tagging to their service.

#### Peak of inflated expectations

> <span>A phase of overenthusiasm and unrealistic projections during which a flurry of publicized </span><span>activity by technology leaders results in some successes but more failures as the technology is </span><span>pushed to its limits. The only enterprises making money at this stage are conference organizers </span><span>and magazine publishers.</span>

In this phase there were indeed many blog posts talking about this subject, as [Louis Rosenfeld](http://louisrosenfeld.com/home/bloug_archive/000330.html)
put it:

> <span>Lately, you can&rsquo;t surf information architecture blogs for five minutes without stumbling on a </span><span>discussion of folksonomies</span>

<span>I guess in this phase many people said things they now feel embarassed about.</span>

**<span>Trough of disillusionment</span>**

> <span>The point at which the technology becomes unfashionable and the press abandons the </span><span>topic, because the technology did not live up to its overinflated expectations.</span>

<span>This is the phase we&rsquo;re in now. There are no blog posts any more. Tagging is not really</span>

unfashionable but the topic is &ldquo;done&rdquo; à la «if that&rsquo;s all what&rsquo;s tagging adds to the web experience, I&rsquo;m not interested in this technology any more». There isn&rsquo;t much thinking and innovation going on.

#### Slope of enlightenment

> <span>Focused experimentation and solid hard work by an increasingly diverse range of organizations </span><span>lead to a true understanding of the technology&rsquo;s applicability, risks and benefits. Commercial </span><span>off-the-shelf methodologies and tools become available to ease the development process.</span>

<span>Let&rsquo;s hope gartner is right about the future of folksonomies!</span>

#### Plateau of productivity

> <span>The real-world benefits of the technology are demonstrated and accepted. Tools and </span><span>methodologies are increasingly stable as they enter their second and third generation. The final </span><span>height of the plateau varies according to whether the technology is broadly applicable or only </span><span>benefits a niche market.</span>

It has yet to show if folksonomies such as in del.icio.us or flickr prove themselves for the masses.

**<span>Update (September, 2007): Do folksonomies apply to hype cycles at all?</span>**

Joe Lamantia [raises the question if tagging should be applied at all to Gartners Hype Cycles:](http://tagsonomy.com/index.php/the-tagging-hype-cycle/)

> <span>Tagging in fact shows few characteristics of the enterprise technologies that Gartner&rsquo;s Hype Cycle is built around</span>

<span>Joe argues rightly, that tagging has not yet reached the broad economy, it&rsquo;s not that Gartner would care to apply folksonomies to their Hype Cycles.</span>

<span>Although: Gartner apply the hype cycle to technologies such as </span>[&ldquo;corporate blogging&rdquo; or wikis](http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=140881&amp;ref=g_SiteLink)<span>. It seems it does not lie in the nature of tagging that it won&rsquo;t ever apply to hype cycles, the only fact that hinders Gartner to apply tagging to their hype cycles is that there is no money earned with it. I&rsquo;m not into business analysis at all so I am grateful for Joes insights which he concludes with:</span>

> <span>If it doesn&rsquo;t cost money, the perceived risks of the technology are lower, and the big analysis firms pay less attention, because their customers see less need to pay for analysis</span>
