If you're fan of my [SEO Kickstarter](https://backl.io) (I just did a silent release of V2) you might be interested in my [Affiliate program](https://backlio.tolt.io/) - I share 40% of all I make with you. Why? Because I think marketing is a big part of the job and with your help I can reach many more potential buyers!

On top of this I'm [giving 1% of my revenue to carbon removal](https://climate.stripe.com/nnEzuF)

If you have any questions about the launch feel free to [book a 30m session with me](https://cal.com/philkellr/seo-kickstarter-v2-onboarding?user=philkellr&overlayCalendar=true)
I also [tried figma make](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1587486574389920821) to redesign the products page but it didn't come out quite right :))
